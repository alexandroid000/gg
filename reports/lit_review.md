MDL-Based Context-Free Graph Grammar Induction and Applications - Jonyer Holder Cook - 2003
===========================================================================================

Abstract: We present an algorithm for the inference of context-free graph gramma
rs from examples. The algorithm builds on an earlier system for frequent
substructure discovery, and is biased toward grammars that minimize description
length. Grammar features include recursion, variables and relationships. We
present an illustrative example, demonstrate the algorithm's ability to learn in
the presence of noise, and show real-world examples.

Concept Formation Using Graph Grammars - Jonyer Holder Cook - 2002
==================================================================

Abstract
--------

Recognizing the expressive power of graph representation and the ability of
certain graph grammars to generalize, we attempt to use graph grammar
learning for concept formation. In this paper we describe our initial progress
toward that goal, and focus on how certain graph grammars can be learned from
examples. We also establish grounds for using graph grammars in machine
learning tasks. Several examples are presented to highlight the validity of
the approach.

Learning Node Replacement Graph Grammars in Metabolic Pathways - Kukluk You Holder Cook - 2007
==============================================================================================

This paper describes graph-based relational, unsupervised learning algorithm to
infer node replacement graph grammar and its application to metabolic pathways.
We search for frequent subgraphs and then check for overlap among the instances
of the subgraphs in the input graph. If subgraphs overlap by one node, we
propose a node replacement graph grammar production. We also can infer a
hierarchy of productions by compressing portions of a graph described by a
production and th en inferring new productions on the compressed graph. We show
learning curves and how the learning process changes when we increase the size
of a sample set. We examine how computation time changes with an increased
number of nodes in the input graphs. We inferred graph grammars from metabolic
pathways which do not change more with increased number of graphs in the input
set. It indicates that graph grammars found represent the input sets well.

Inferring the Structure of Graph Grammars from Data - Doshi Huang Oats - 
=========================================================================

Abstract
--------

Graphs can be used to represent such diverse entities as chemical compounds,
transportation networks, and the world wide web. Stochastic graph grammars are
compact representations of probability distributions over graphs. We present an
algorithm for inferring stochastic graph grammars from data. That is, given a
set of graphs that, for example, correspond to a set of chemical compounds, all
of which have some desirable property, the algorithm uncovers the structure
shared by the graphs and represents it in the form of a stochastic graph
grammar. The inferred grammar assigns high probability to the graphs from which
it was learned and low probability to other graphs. We report results of
preliminary experiments in which inferred graph grammars are compared to target
grammars used to generated training data.
